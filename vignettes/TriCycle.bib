	abstract = {{The cell cycle is among the most basic phenomena in biology. Despite advances in single‐cell analysis, dynamics and topology of the cell cycle in high‐dimensional gene expression space remain largely unknown. We developed a linear analysis of transcriptome data which reveals that cells move along a planar circular trajectory in transcriptome space during the cycle. Non‐cycling gene expression adds a third dimension causing helical motion on a cylinder. We find in immortalized cell lines that cell cycle transcriptome dynamics occur largely independently from other cellular processes. We offer a simple method (“Revelio”) to order unsynchronized cells in time. Precise removal of cell cycle effects from the data becomes a straightforward operation. The shape of the trajectory implies that each gene is upregulated only once during the cycle, and only two dynamic components represented by groups of genes drive transcriptome dynamics. It indicates that the cell cycle has evolved to minimize changes of transcriptional activity and the related regulatory effort. This design principle of the cell cycle may be of relevance to many other cellular differentiation processes. Deep single‐cell RNA sequencing of asynchronous immortalized cycling cells is leveraged to analyze the cell cycle in highdimensional gene expression space. Principles of dynamical systems theory are utilized to define a cell cycle trajectory and to seek for underlying design principles. The cell cycle corresponds to a 2D circular trajectory in gene expression space, which suggests minimization of changes of gene expression velocity in this space (minimization of “acceleration”) as a general design principle of the cell cycle. Cell cycle gene expression in immortalized cell lines is largely uncoupled from other biological processes. A novel linear analysis of single‐cell data that orders unsynchronized proliferating cells in time and surgically removes cell cycle effects. Deep single‐cell RNA sequencing of asynchronous immortalized cycling cells is leveraged to analyze the cell cycle in high‐dimensional gene expression space. Principles of dynamical systems theory are utilized to define a cell cycle trajectory and to seek for underlying design principles.}},

	abstract = {{Analysis of gene expression in single cells allows for decomposition of cellular states as low-dimensional latent spaces. However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.}},
